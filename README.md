##### For my map I decided to focus on the general Seattle area. I used a minimum zoom level of 10 and a maximum zoom level of 14 while creating all of my tiles
### Tile 1: Modified Basemap

##### Caption: In order to create this basemap, I started with the Light Monochromatic themed basemap on Mapbox. Then from here, I wanted to start by altering the colors so that I could make the basemap have a bit more contrast. I changed the water to dark blue and also changed the greenspace to pale green. For all of these base colors, I chose dull colors so that data/text on this map would be more easily readable. Then I also changed all the font on my map to variations of Arial Unicode because I thought this would make the map easier to read.
